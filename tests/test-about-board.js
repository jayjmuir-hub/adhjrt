   The About-section rotating photo RING (5 Aug 2026), and the one bug it
   shipped with.

   ⚠️ WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL. The ring arrived across eleven commits and
   ~520 new lines in `Quins JRT.dc.html` with NOT ONE new assertion behind it.
   The fault count was 499 before it and 499 after. By this project's own rule
   — a change nothing asserts is a change that silently regresses — that was a
   gap, and it was found by rendering the deployed page, not by a check.

   ⚠️⚠️ THE BUG, because it will be re-introduced by anyone typing ordinary
   JavaScript into this page. The component engine runs `encodeCase()` over the
   WHOLE component before parsing it, and its regex

       /(\s)([a-z]+[A-Z][A-Za-z0-9]*)(\s*=)/g

   exists to survive HTML's case-insensitive attribute names. It DOES NOT STOP
   AT <script> BOUNDARIES. So a local variable written as whitespace + camelCase
   + "=" is rewritten into a kebab-case `sc-camel-…` attribute name wherever it
   appears — including inside a script. The board script declared its
   screen-visibility flag in camelCase, it became `sc-camel-on-screen=`, and the
   copy of the script the engine mounts into <head> threw

       SyntaxError: Failed to execute 'appendChild' on 'Node': Unexpected token '-'

   on EVERY load of adhjrt.com. The ring still worked, because a second
   unmangled copy of the same script executes in place — which is exactly why
   nobody noticed: the symptom was a console error and a page that looked fine.
   Rendering `ba5028d` and `e7056ba` side by side is what pinned it to this
   change. The general sweep below is the guard, and it is deliberately a sweep
   over EVERY inline script in EVERY component, not a check on one variable
   name: the next one will not be called onScreen.

   Structural, not visual. This reads the page as text. It cannot tell you the
   ring looks right — only that the pieces that make it work are present, agree
   with each other, and reference files that exist. The geometry was measured by
   rendering the deployed page at 1400 / 1000 / 390px (panel 74.3 / 74.0 / 74.0%
   of the box); the numbers pinned here are the inputs to that. */
